            Virtual sensors leverage developments on the artificial intelligence and machine learning front to allow for data-driven approaches to estimate key process parameters. In addition to being less expensive, virtual sensors provide an interesting alternative when a physical sensor cannot be placed in the preferred position due to spatial conditions (e.g. lack of room for a sensor) or a hostile environment (e.g. exposure to acids or extreme temperatures). Virtual sensor technology can reduce signal noise and, thus, increase confidence in the signals when a sensorâ€™s output is confirmed by other sensors measuring the same phenomenon. Finally, virtual sensors are extremely flexible and can be redesigned as required, whereas physical sensors, once installed, often can only be repositioned by mechanical intervention.
